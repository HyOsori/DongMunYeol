# DongMunYeol : Osori's private room checking system
## Overview

## Specification
- Arduino uno & wifi shield

## Step 1

## Step 2

## Step 3 : Ultrasonic Sensor
- Decision is done by difference between long distance(over 10cm, Meaning close) and short distance(within 10cm, Meaning open). When room's card key is placed into key holder, distance calculated by ultrasonic sensor is shortened(within 10cm). Therefore arduino can decide whether room is open or not.
